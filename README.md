# Home_Sales


## DESCRIPTION
This is my submission for the Module 22 SparkSQL challenge.

## Usage
I did this assignment in Jupyter Notebook, so the code is in the file named Home_Sales_starter_code.ipynb. In order to run this code, the user just needs to open that file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run through the cells in order.

## Note
I wasn't 100% sure what the instructions were asking for in the cell where we had to find the view rating so I just found the average view ratings for Homes priced above $350k
